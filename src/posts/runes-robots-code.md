**_Do you believe in predetermined paths?_**

From the moment we take our first breath, are our lives already laid out for us? Well, if you know the answer, you'd have to tell me because Iâ€™m clueless and eager to find out.

### RuneScape Realizations

Our story begins in my early childhood in Reading, Berkshire, where I stumbled upon a game that would have a massive influence on my life. It shaped the way I think about the world and what I do today.

Enter **RuneScape**. If youâ€™ve heard of it or played it, you probably know what Iâ€™m talking about. RuneScape is an MMORPG that's been around forever. In my early teens, my brother and I were practically glued to our screens, living in the world of _Gielinor_. My understanding of geography? All thanks to the gameâ€™s mini-map. That tiny circle with cardinal points taught me how to navigate maps. I still picture my surroundings this way, from a birds eye view.

As a kid, all I wanted to do was play RuneScape, start a YouTube channel, and build a website. Lofty goals for a ten-year-old, right? Oddly enough, I accomplished all of them. I even created my own offline RuneScape Private Server (RSPS) ðŸ˜…. My memory is foggy on how exactly I did that, but hey, the internet always had the answers.

Interestingly, I was introduced to Scratch programming in my ICT class at school, but it didnâ€™t quite catch my fancy. I built a few games and quickly forgot about it.

### Robots Rule

Boarding school. Need I say more? This phase introduced me to Roboticsâ€”Lego Mindstorms, to be exact. It felt almost natural. I loved assembling those Lego pieces, but the real magic was in the programmable NXT head. Attach a part here, add a few instructions there, and voila! Your own robotic creation. Want it to follow a line? Use a light sensor. Sort colors? Bring in the color sensor! Want it to play golf? Give it a swinging arm!

I had a blast with those NXT and later EV3 robots. They sparked my desire to learn how to code.

### Code Chaos

By the time I reached university, I had taught myself HTML and CSS, only to be greeted by C++ in my first year. Ah, the joys of higher education! There were numerous projects and crazy experiments, from installing custom ROMs on my phone to building Android spyware and Windows viruses. Yes, I did these for funâ€”I wanted to understand how things worked.

One project that often comes to mind is _*HearAI*_. Letâ€™s rewind to 2018/2019. AI and ML were the buzzwords of the era.<br/>
In my third year, I had what I thought was a brilliant idea: an app to help people who couldn't see or read the language. Point it at some text, and it would use OCR to extract and read it out loud. I built the app in Flutter, using Firebase's ML Kit. Little did I know, Google was working on something quite similar with Google Lens!

### The Journey Continues

And that brings us to today, where Iâ€™m still exploring the wacky world of software engineering. From RuneScape to robots, and from custom ROMs to AI projects, it's been one heck of a ride.

Who knows what comes next? Stick around, and let's find out together!
