Hello there 👋🏽. It's about time I created this, right? Yeah, see, I knew you'd think so too.
<br/>  
Oh, what's a Dev log, you ask? Well, it's my fun way of saying a mind dump.  
I think this might be an exciting way to learn, educate others, and tell interesting developer stories. A diary of sorts, if you will.
<br/><br/>
Have fun and read whatever interests you!
